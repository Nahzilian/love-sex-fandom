            With the increasing popularity of “BookTok”—TikTok’s book-reading sub-group—young adult romance novels have
            become a frequent topic of discussion on social media. Creators and readers alike share their favourite
            books and gush over characters they’re crushing on, almost like an online book club. However, the mainstream
            conversation lacks books with diversity, as many popular books center on white characters and experiences.
            While classics like <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> and recent releases like <em>The Hating Game</em> highlight
            riveting romance, it’s time they share the spotlight. That’s why we put together a list of five fictional
            romances featuring racialized main characters and relationships; because every reader deserves to see their
            background and culture reflected in the main character—especially when they’re experiencing some fun and
            raunchy romance.

            <strong>1. <em>Get a Life, Chloe Brown</em> by Talia Hibbert</strong><br><br>
            The first of a trilogy following the lives of three sisters, <em>Get a Life, Chloe Brown</em> follows the
            titular character as she attempts to discover the adventurous side of her personality. After a close call
            with death, Brown—described as a chronically-ill computer geek—sets out to complete a bucket list to live
            life to the fullest. That’s when she meets Red Morgan, a rebellious artist who she recruits to help with her
            adventure. Hibbert’s other two books in the series, <em>Take a Hint, Dani Brown</em> and <em>Act Your Age,
                Eve Brown</em>, are also worth exploring as they also feature Black main characters and interracial
            relationships.

            <strong>2. <em>Honey Girl</em> by Morgan Rogers</strong><br><br>

            While not strictly about romance, Rogers’ debut novel illustrates love in many ways; through queer
            relationships, friendship and self-discovery. <em>Honey Girl</em> tells the story of 28-year-old Grace
            Porter and her experience navigating life after finishing her PhD in astronomy. After a fun night out in Las
            Vegas, Grace wakes up the next morning married to Yuki Yamamoto, a woman from New York City whom she barely
            knows. On top of that, her new wife has already left Vegas and is on her way back home. When Grace’s job
            search proves unsuccessful, she decides to travel to New York City to find Yuki. As the book progresses,
            Grace’s spontaneous journey helps her understand herself as a queer Black woman, as she learns to recognize
            and cope with her emotions and burnout.

            <strong>3. <em>Josh and Hazel’s Guide to Not Dating</em> by Christina Lauren</strong>
            
            
            <br><br>

            For fans of the friends-to-lovers trope, this book is for you! <em>Josh and Hazel’s Guide to Not Dating</em>
            features two main characters, Josh and Hazel, who have been friends for over a decade and slowly begin to
            realize their love for each other. The story's protagonist, Josh Im is Korean-American and his traditional
            Korean background is woven into the narrative through Korean culture and family details.

            <strong>4. <em>Love from A to Z</em> by S.K. Ali</strong><br><br>
            A compelling and heartfelt novel, <em>Love from A to Z</em> follows Zayneb, who is mixed-Pakistani and West
            Indian, and Adam, who is of Chinese and Finnish descent, as their love progresses. Throughout the story,
            their relationship is challenged by racism and personal struggles. The book addresses Islamophobia, the
            mourning of lost loved ones and chronic illness while illustrating the beauty of love.
            <br><br>


            <strong>5. <em>Meet Cute Club</em> by Jack Harbon</strong><br><br>
            Hop on this journey as we watch a relationship between the two male main characters, Jordan Collins and Rex
            Bailey, progress from annoyance to attraction. Jordan hosts a romance book club, and Rex, who Jordan finds
            “frustratingly obnoxious,” keeps nagging him about joining. The two eventually team up to revive the
            withering book club and Jordan discovers that maybe Rex isn’t so bad after all. Harbon’s novel incorporates
            an enemies-to-lovers storyline with the familiarity of a bookstore setting.
