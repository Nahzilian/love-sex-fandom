            It all started three summers ago back in Kerr Hall.
            <br><br>

            I saw their fabric ram horns disappear around a corner one day after an anthropology class and something
            told me I had to hunt down the beautiful buck. <i>Follow that mascot</i>, my aching heart said.
            <br><br>

            I was a bit behind, so by the time I turned the corner the costumed Casanova was out of sight. But they were
            stuck in my mind.
            <br><br>

            The next time I finished class, I was the first one out the door, but the last to leave the building. I
            <i>had</i> to see them again.
            <br><br>

            I stood there for a while losing hope, but there they were. The hallway stretched infinitely between me and
            them. There must have been a crowd, but Eggy was all I could see.
            <br><br>

            In slow-motion, my eyes panned upwards, past the hooves and basketball uniform and right into their beady
            eyes.
            <br><br>

            It was now or never. I <i>needed</i> Eggy to notice me.
            <br><br>

            Abruptly, I stepped forward, right in their path just as they were about to pass me and we bumped into one
            another.
            <br><br>

            “Oh- I- I’m so sorry,” I said, flustered. I look down thinking I messed up big time.
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center">
                <img src="./assets/eggy-fanfic/eggyfanfic_vanessa_Feb2022-01.png" width="300" class="float-right"><br>
            </div>
            Suddenly, I felt fuzzy hands lightly touching my arms and holding me. I look up.
            <br><br>

            “Are you okay Y/N?” Eggy asked.
            <br><br>

            A fierce blush spread all the way up to my ears upon hearing my name. I was so close I could almost see
            their real identity.
            <br><br>

            “Yes, yeah, thank you!” I stammered. <i>Shit, now's the time to say something</i>, I told myself. But,
            nothing came out. I stood there gaping at them like a fish.
            <br><br>

            “Good,” the beautiful buck said nonchalantly.
            <br><br>

            Eggy walked past me. <i>I’ve messed up and it’s all over</i>, I thought.
            <br><br>

            But then, the big head turned around and those Ram horns pointed straight at me with a nod.
            <br><br>

            “See you in class, Y/N.”
            <br><br><br>


            [Author’s Note: AHHHHH tysm for reading my work, sorry if it’s all over the place :P was in a rush after 3
            all-nighters for class and my full-time job, nearly missed my half-dad’s engagement party but i typed this
            out in the bathroom hehe!! A reminder my commissions are open on tumblr ;P And as I say with all of my Eggy
            fics I acknowledge the name Eggy comes from Egerton Ryerson and all names in fics will be changed once the
            name change is final!! ]
