        <div class="content">

            Growing up, romance and intimacy were not discussed in my household. My parents divorced when I was three,
            and since then it's been a taboo subject because of the emotional toll the separation took on my family.
            Living in a small town, turning to my friends for relationship and sex advice was also not an option for
            fear of these conversations becoming selacious gossip. This made the internet my judgement-free zone, where
            I could read
            and learn about sex at my own pace.
            <br><br>
            Through fanfiction and smut, I read works that didn’t centre heterosexual leads for the first time, and it
            was exhilarating. These fictional characters in different worlds were roleplaying every scenario I had in my
            fantasies, from simple romantic dates to getting my shit rocked in bed.
            <br><br>
            Reading queer stories also allowed me to explore my sexuality beyond the heteronormative ideals pushed on me
            in movies and sex-ed classes. I finally found characters I could relate to without worrying about judgement
            from friends and family.I was just another reader online—I didn't exist. The only thing the authors knew
            about me was that I shared their passion for smut and sexual pleasure.
            <br>
            <br>
            During my first year in university, my classmates talked openly in Whatsapp group chats about reading smut
            and fanfiction, sending recommendations to each other. It was very different from when I was in high school
            and never brought up smut or porn with my friends. I liked the sense of openness. Since then, I’ve become
            more open and don’t feel like I have to hide that I find pleasure in the works I read.
            I also feel more represented when reading smut as opposed to watching traditional porn, which is often
            male-oriented. Many straight men fetishize lesbian sex, which assumes women are objects for male pleasure,
            according to an <a href="https://lustery.com/pov/article/straight-dudes-with-penises-stop-fetishizing-les
            bian-sex-and-start-learning-from-it" target="_blank">article</a> from Lustery. It’s
            easier for me to find characters like myself in queer or general non-heterosexual self-published smut than
            porn produced by big porn companies.

            Smut is sexually explicit writing, usually in the form of erotic novels, fanfictions and even short <a
                href="https://twitter.com/kinkizai/status/1472511942787047429?s=20&t=6BfhcWHBoa GeL810vwJoww"
                target="_blank">Twitter threads</a>. While erotica has been around since about the fifth <a
                href="https://www.britannica.com/art/erotica" target="_blank">century AD</a>, more youth are talking
            openly about smut in young adult books and fanfiction because of TikTok, where many <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aymansbooks/video/7044973644270832942?is_from_w
                ebapp=1&sender_device=pc&web_id7034772571456472582" target="_blank">creators</a> discuss and recommend
            their favourite works.
            <br><br>
            Beatrice Phan, a writer and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@beatricebphan" target="_blank">Tiktoker</a> who
            talks about smut, says reading smut and
            being publicly open about it has made her feel more comfortable in her own skin. She says when she was
            younger, she used to mold herself into someone she wanted others to like, never discussing smut or
            sexuality. Reading smut allowed her to move away from repressing her sexuality. “[I feel] more like myself,”
            she says.
            <br><br>
            Phan creates videos about erotic novels like <em>The Original Sinners</em>, <em>The Brown Sisters</em> and
            <em>BJ Alex</em>—all queer smut with Asian representation and different genres like omegaverse, an alternate
            universe in which males can get pregnant.
            <br><br>
            Through her content, she’s created an open, safe environment where TikTok users can comment and share their
            personal experiences. “It makes people realize it’s OK to talk about these things and realize they’re not
            alone in the world, and they can express themselves this way as well,” says Phan.
            <br>
            <div style="text-align: center;">

                    width="200" class="float-left"><br>
            </div>

            Growing up, she never really saw Asian characters in books, so she’d have to imagine herself in the plots of
            other characters. This is why one of the main themes in Phan’s content is promoting and encouraging her
            followers to diversify their readings with books featuring queer and Asian representation. “It’s important
            to show people that they can be happy too, they can have these stories as well, it’s not just these other
            [heterosexual, cisgender] people.”
            <br><br>
            Smut is more than just a way to indulge in your sexual preferences and kinks, but an opportunity to discover
            a range of diverse authors and characters not typically seen in traditional publishing and literature.
            <br><br>
            In a 2021 scholarly <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/15274764211016305"
                target="_blank">article</a>
            published in Television & New Media, author Jennifer Duggan looks at two trans and genderqueer individuals'
            experiences with fanfiction. The study found that when individuals couldn’t find traditionally published
            books that mirrored their identities, fanfiction became a substitute. For one subject in the study,
            fanfiction provided important identity models for him to discover his sexuality—getting his sex education
            “largely from the fan world.”

            Zara Alvi* accidentally discovered smut during her early teenage years while reading a Percy Jackson
            fanfiction. Since then, it’s become part of the fourth-year engineering student’s regular content
            consumption.
            <br><br>
            Reading smut has helped Alvi understand her own body, consent and romantic relationship dynamics more
            in-depth, too. While she doesn’t recommend reading smut as young as she did, she says it helped her discover
            her sexual preferences early on in her life. One of the reasons smut appeals to Alvi more than mainstream
            porn is that it’s more approachable and softer than other forms of the same material like video or audio
            porn, which she says can be overwhelming. She adds that the way in which people discuss porn can be vulgar
            and sexist.
            <br><br>
            “The context in which people talk about porn is so aggressive,” says Alvi. “It could be because of my
            program and the type of people in [it]. I find when my girls and I talk about smut, it’s definitely gentler,
            it’s friendlier and not as aggressive.” Alvi sees smut as a safe space for her to exist in as the writers
            from most of the works she reads come from a similar background and look more like her, as opposed to video
            porn which tends
            to centre white actors and be produced by white male directors.
            <br><br>
            With more than 10 erotic novels under her pen name, erotica writer Julie Matlin says although it’s not as
            overproduced as other pornography, one must remember that smut is only fantasy. When she watched the 2014
            historical drama, <em>Outlander</em>, she said to herself during a sex scene that there’s no way a woman is
            orgasming that fast. Like video, written erotica can still be as unrealistic in terms of sex. This is why
            Matlin says, “it’s not a perfect solution,” for setting realistic expectations. While smut can offer
            avenues for readers to explore and express their sexualities, it’s important to remember that it is still
            fiction.
            <br><br>
            Matlin adds that she tries to make her characters as human and everyday as possible while still being hot
            and fun. “My characters will stumble through a sex scene, they’ll laugh through a sex scene.” She likes to
            add scenes that people can relate to in real life, like nipple and tongue piercings getting stuck on each
            other during a steamy moment.
            <br><br>
            Smut has the ability to allow us to both explore our sexualities and immerse ourselves in alternative
            realities we may have never dreamed of being a part of. From the comfort of my bed, I'm able to read both
            soft sex scenes or vicariously partake in my wildest fantasies through words written on a page.
            <br><br>
            I'm no longer searching for the words to describe my sexuality or preferences. I'm not hiding the fact that
            as a woman, I read smut and consume porn, because it's something almost all humans do regardless of gender
            or sexual preferences. If you find a place in this world that fits you and you feel safe to exist in—and it
            doesn't harm or fetishize anyone—that's a win in my books, and you shouldn't shy away from talking about it.
