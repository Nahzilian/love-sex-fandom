            From Ted Cruz x Marco Rubio fanfics to sexual awakenings inspired by a certain rap musical about the
            American Founding Fathers, many Ryerson students have explored the full range of what the fictional world
            has to offer. This year‚Äôs Love and Sex survey asked students how fanfiction and fictional romances
            influenced their understandings of themselves and relationships with others. Take a look at some of their
            insights about fandom, sexuality and community here:
            <br>
            <br>
            <strong>Which famous person or niche microcelebrity do you have the strongest parasocial relationship
                with?</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>

                <li>Pete Davidson. Also Eggy The Ram. Same vibe</li><br>

                <li>Anna Marie Tendler</li><br>

                <li>Gong Yoo, I replayed the slapping scene from <em>Squid Game</em> so many times</li><br>

                <li>Harry Styles &lt;333 </li><br>

                <li>Andrew Garfield‚Ä¶</li><br>

                <li>Adam Driver (in an extremely platonic way, I think we‚Äôd be great buddies)</li><br>

                <li>Gillian Anderson</li><br>

                <li>I would say Beyonc√© but like it‚Äôs not sexual?</li><br>

            </ul>
            <strong>What‚Äôs the weirdest, most unhinged fanfiction you‚Äôve ever read?</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    One time I was looking for Canadian authors on Wattpad and found multiple Justin Trudeau fanfics‚Ä¶
                    Watch
                    young French-Canadian daddy fuck an entire country I guess
                </li><br>


                <li>Obama and Harry Styles &lt;3</li><br>

                <li>

                    Most unhinged was a 300,000-word Dramione (Draco x Hermione) fanfiction that was published in 2013.
                    Genuinely one of the most devastating pieces of literature I‚Äôve ever read, to the point where I keep
                    a copy of the PDF on my hard drive and have transferred it to every single device I‚Äôve ever owned
                    (phone, laptop, iPad). A true masterpiece
                </li><br>

                <li>

                    Ted Cruz/Marco Rubio (I later met the dude who wrote it at a political rally, but that‚Äôs a whole
                    other story)
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    The Forbidden Days of McPhantom on Archive of Our Own (a Danny Phantom x Lightning McQueen fic)
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    Probably Harry Styles‚Äô sex slave

                    One my friends wrote about me and Ashton Irwin, who I thought I was actually talking to (I was 13).
                    It was not him...it was another 13-year-old girl. She now has two kids and is married to a man who
                    looks like a rat.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    Probably fanfics of Voldemort, like girl he‚Äôs a nazi why you glorified him????

                <li>
                    <em>Little Women</em>! I realized through Jo March that women do not have to be romance-focused or
                    obsessed with sexuality.

                </li><br>

                <li>

                    Hamilton (this is the worst fact about me)
                </li><br>

                <li>

                    Terrible, terrible sports anime
                </li><br>

                <li>

                    One Direction, specifically Larry Stylinson
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> and <em>Life is Strange</em> are both video games, but I find them
                    relevant. They portray lesbians in a way that doesn't fetishize them. However, I think One Direction
                    and 5 Seconds of Summer fanfiction helped me realize that I had compulsory heterosexuality to some
                    degree. Fanfiction was a way I could engage with sexual content which involved men without actually
                    having to enact it...and with that distance, I could convince myself that I liked it. I still read
                    it sometimes, but I understand that literary representations of men aren't the same as the real
                    thing LOL

                </li><br>

            </ul>
            <strong>Has reading or watching romance raised your standards for future romantic relationships? If so,
                how?</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
                <ul>

                <li>
                    Consuming romance media is like test-driving romantic scenarios. It gives you a hypothetical that
                    allows you to think about how you‚Äôd react to that situation as one of the people in the
                    relationship. It‚Äôs helped me somewhat get a sense of my boundaries, what I want from a relationship
                    and what I see as red flags by presenting examples, from good to bad.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    It certainly stressed me out growing up, since many, if not all, romance novels and movies depict an
                    intense, romantic, sexual whirlwind relationship that all women must fall into. Where is the
                    depiction of the asexuality and/or aromanticism? Where is the representation of people who do not
                    fall under the sexual or romantic umbrella?
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    I think it set standards for men who respect their partners and want what‚Äôs best for them. We always
                    talk about loving your partners but fictional romance made me realize that love must encompass
                    respect, consent and genuine well-wishes or it‚Äôs not real love!
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Yes lol friends with benefits and no strings attached tropes made me believe I would end up in a
                    relationship with my fuck buddy.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    Yes (unfortunately). My expectations for how I think I should be pursued (courted, even) have risen
                    exponentially. I deleted Snapchat and I don‚Äôt use dating apps; I want to be desired for me, rather
                    than my body. This has rather limited my options in university lol.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    Absolutely. I think no matter the variety of things I read, it shows that your worth is SO
                    IMPORTANT. I know when I do get into a relationship I know my worth and standards because of what
                    I‚Äôve read.
                </li><br>

            </ul>
            <strong>What has being a part of a fandom helped you learn about yourself and your relationships with
                others?</strong>
            <br>
            <br>
                <ul>

                <li>
                    I‚Äôm not a weirdo!! There‚Äôs so many people with way wilder fantasies and desires than me. Shame
                    around sex and wanting pleasure makes people view their desires as strange, but because fandom
                    embraces the wildest of fantasies, it makes me feel normal.

                </li><br>

                <li>

                    I learned that I am very creative! And that I could create a whole new world with pictures and
                    words.
                </li><br>

                <li>

                    I met so many of my best friends in fandoms and am IRL friends with some and visit some in different
                    countries sometimes too! Being friends with people for upwards of ten years, especially long
                    distance, has taught me that with good friends you can pick up where you left off. Visiting my
                    online friends also made me realize what I value in my IRL friendships and taught me not to let
                    people be half-assed with me

                </li><br>
                <li>

                    Yes I have learned that some people are really and truly fucked beyond belief and that sometimes you
                    just gotta turn your computer off and stare at the ceiling.
                </li><br>

                <li>
                    I'm gay and I love fantasy escapism. That seems crude, but it's true. Fanfiction is also incredibly
                    comforting to me because it isn't always sexual, it can simply be a way of extending the time you
                    spend in another world which you hold dearly to your heart. Who wouldn't love to do that?
