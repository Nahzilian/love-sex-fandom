            <b><em>If you picked mostly As…</em></b>
            <br><br>
            Your controversial ship is Rey and Kylo Ren from the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise. Maybe you have an
            interrogation kink—I would too if it was by the hand of Adam Driver. You can be hot-headed, but this just
            stems from your strong will and passion, which is all well and good if you’re not using your Jedi mind
            tricks for torturous purposes. To further your Reylo fantasies, read <em>The Love Hypothesis</em> by Ali
            Hazelwood, which once used to literally be a Reylo fic before it got published!
            <br><br>
            <b><em>If you picked mostly Bs…</em></b>
            <br><br>
            Your controversial ship is Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson from One Direction. What makes YOU beautiful
            (wink wink) is how wholesome you undeniably are, and while you might be pretty social, you like to get to
            know someone before you enter a relationship. You’re creative, passionate and love to live life to the
            fullest. For more band romance, watch the Netflix original series <em>Julie and the Phantoms</em>.

            <img src="./assets/which-controversial-ship-are-you/LSF_tsmall assets_vanessa_Jan2022-01 (2).png"
                width="150" class="float-right"><br>
            </div>
            <b><em>If you picked mostly Cs…</em></b>
            <br><br>
            Your controversial ship is Jacob Black and Renesmee Cullen from the <em>Twilight</em> series. Maybe you’re
            into people younger than you, or people older than
            you…or you belong in jail. Whatever the case is, you definitely
            appreciate solitude and would not complain if a giant werewolf were to
            leap out of the woods, tell you to get on their back and take you away
            with them forever. For more romantic werewolf drama, check out the TV show <em>Teen Wolf</em>.
            <br><br>
            <b><em>If you picked mostly Ds…</em></b>
            <br><br>
            Your controversial ship is Steve Rogers and Sharon Carter from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Maybe you had
            a bad breakup and thought that rather than moving on to someone entirely new, you’d just pick their sibling,
            or in Steve’s case, their niece. Like Steve and Sharon, you’re stubborn and always set on doing what you
            believe is the right thing, even if there are people standing in your way. For more confusing familial attraction meets lack of aging, try watching the film
            <em>The Age of Adaline</em>.
